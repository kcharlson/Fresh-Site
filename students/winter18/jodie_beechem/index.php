    <p>Jodie is an illustrator and designer living in Portland, OR. She is constantly inspired by scientific illustrations, tattoo flash, and anything remotely spooky. When she’s not being creative, she's usually either watching live music at a local venue, or is at an arcade playing pinball.</p>

    <h2>PDX Pop Now!</h2>
    <p>Working with the all ages music festival PDX Pop Now! I created a flexible illustrated system for them to use both for promotional material and for merchandise. The main graphic will be printed on tshirts, totes, and other goodies to be sold at the festival this summer. </p>

    <h2>Ice Queens T-shirt</h2>
    <p>Working with bands to make their music come alive through a design is one of my favorite things. For this tshirt, I created a custom illustration and typeface for Portland metal band, Ice Queens. (Photo: Sarah Nienaber, Model: Shannon Kidd)</p>

    <h2>What Was Sound</h2>
    <p>Illustrated graphics for Portland music festival What Was Sound as part of the Portland Rose Festival. With a mix of cutting edge indie acts and up-and-coming local bands, I wanted to create a graphic that could appeal to a large audience, while staying true to Portland’s edge.</p>
