    <h2>You’re A Bad/Good Customer </h2>
    <p>I’ve been working in customer service for a while now and it isn’t great. It takes a lot of strength to not yell at someone who is yelling at you. To help channel my frustrations, I made a bad customer form and for those rare occasions that a customer isn’t all bad, a good customer form. Intended to be given to the customer but not recommended. </p>

    <h2>Fruits I like, And Stuff About Them</h2>
    <p>People in my life would consider me a picky eater. I’ve been asked questions like “What do you eat?” and “Do you like anything?”. This booklet was made as an answer to those questions and an informative guide. While I do like more than four fruits (and food other than fruit) at least this proves I like something. </p>
