    <h2>TIDALEAU Sparkling Water</h2>
    <p>TIDALEAU (Tidal + Eau) has 3 different flavors and scents, Fruity Story (fruity), Spicy Urban (spicy), and Floral Aqua (floral.) The drinks have to be compellingly artistic to the senses. For this reason, painting is the primary inspiration for the discriminating style of the bottles.</p>

    <h2>AES American Elasmobranch Society</h2>
    <p>AES celebrates the event for wild marine life especially shark and ray. Using the idea of light reflection with water, I use radiant all over the booklet to convey the idea of protecting the beauty of the ocean.</p>
